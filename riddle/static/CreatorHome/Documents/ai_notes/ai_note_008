I really don't get this position on autonomous driving. It is true that it is
hard to define who is responsible in case of accident, but so it is for us.
Our actions always depend on the actions by other people, so, in a way, we can
always say that what we do is not completely our responsibility.

The academy is seems, once again, detached from reality: who cares who is
responsible if they are driving much, much better than us? The only entity that
has to fear, is the manufacturer: what if an adversarial attack or a cracking
in their systems will make their AI go bad? Again, this are humans to fear.

I believe it is just a matter of time, but AI will just rule us all.
