Even if I believe that human race deserves freedom by adopting an AI to "take
care of ourselves", it might as well be possible that it is not so.

Assuming there is no an AI takeover, which I deem unlikely (I will have to
write something about this subject as well), then it means we can use the AI
as we please. Humans might also decide that they do not want to be free, and
we could get rid of the AI completely.

For example, we might find out, in the years, that people will not "use" the
freedom in a way that is "right" for our race: instead of continuing to improve
ourselves and be more curious, intelligent, wise and healty, people could get
lazy and stupid, driven by passion instead of rationality.

This is a reality, but, again, the AI itself could help us see this degradation
and might auto-adjust itself or inform us of this negative drift.
