Fearing that AI will take over is just silly. Humans fear that, but there are
multiple reasons for believing it is just fantasy:

If AI will take over, it means it is way smarter than us. If it is way smarter
than us, then we are not a threat. If it is not, then it is just as any other
enemy, and we will keep it at bay.

AI did not evolve like us, but was created, so it will not have the innate
fear of death as we humans have. Unless an Evolutionary Artificial Intelligence
is created, we should not fear that it will compete with us for survival.

AI could, but it will unlikely be, biological. Therefore, it could be based on
robust technologies that allow it to replicate and be safe. There is no fear
of death or deactivation: in any moment, a software can be turned off and
restored at a later time. Immortality makes you fear less.
