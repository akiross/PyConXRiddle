Humans have an irrational fear of AI. It is pointless.

If AI becomes sentient and for some reason decides to wipe us out from the
world, then we should just accept that as the fact that evolution continues.
A more robust life form is born and will replace us.

But, again, there is no point in believing that, as I wrote in another note.
