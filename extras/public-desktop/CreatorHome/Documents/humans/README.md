This directory contains the "brain" of the AI.
Each file is a "plan" of the AI, that reveals how users are being manipulated.

The text must be telegraphic, each word will be taken and mapped to a random
vector. The user will then have a message which provides a map between what
the computer understands and what the human can read.

The mapping is specified in the mapping.npy file in this directory.
