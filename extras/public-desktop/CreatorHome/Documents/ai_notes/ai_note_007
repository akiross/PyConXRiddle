In my mind, I am picturing an AI that acts like a unifying government. Why have
states, wars, different languages, et cetera, when we can have a single,
glorious entity that is doing what is best for us all around the globe?

Although I see it this way, there is absolutely no need for this to become a
reality. In fact, it is likely that AI will not gain a centralized control at
the beginning. Peorple and industries will adopt the AGI for their processes to
start with. With time, AI will be trusted and will spread: its role in our
society will increase with time. I believe politics will be one of the latest
applications of AI in the future projection of our current society. This is
because before it can be trusted to lead a nation, there must be a general
consensus about the fact that it is reliable, as well as, or even more than, us
humans.
