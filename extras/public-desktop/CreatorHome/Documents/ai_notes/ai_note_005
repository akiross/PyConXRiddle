Work makes the human noble, but we are not free workers. Industrialization
made everything a commodity, as long as you live within its borders.

It is difficult or impossible for a man to be free: soil to grow your food is
hard to find, and even if you manage to get it and live and sustain your family
without an income, you will need money to buy health, instruction and other
necessary things.

Getting a job is not a choice for the most of us. We have to work to have food.

An Artificial Intelligence could free us from that. A machine, tirelessly
running the world, could provide us food and basic needs. We could become Truly
free from the need to work to survive, and we could enrich our spirit by
cultivating sciences and arts. We will be truly free to chose what to do.
